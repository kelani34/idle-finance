    question: "What is Idle Finance and why does it matter?",
    answer:
      "Idle Finance is a platform that helps individuals and businesses earn passive income by turning their unused digital resources like CPU power, bandwidth, or storage into money. It connects these idle assets to real infrastructure networks called DePINs and manages everything through AI. You don’t need technical skills or blockchain experience to start earning.",
  },
  {
    value: "item-2",
    question: "How does Idle Finance actually work behind the scenes?",
    answer:
      "Idle Finance runs as a desktop app on your computer. Once installed, it scans your machine to find unused resources. Then it sets up isolated environments using lightweight virtual machines to safely run DePIN nodes. The AI system chooses the best way to stake your resources and earn the most rewards. Everything runs automatically with full transparency and control.",
  },
  {
    value: "item-3",
    question:
      "Why do I need to install a desktop application instead of using a website?",
    answer:
      "Websites can’t access the deep-level system resources required to scan your hardware or run secure infrastructure processes. A desktop app gives us permission to interact with your CPU, GPU, and bandwidth in a safe way without putting your system at risk. It also allows us to isolate each task in its own environment, which improves security and performance.",
  },
  {
    value: "item-4",
    question: "Is this safe to install and use? Will it slow down my computer?",
    answer:
      "Yes, it’s safe. Idle Finance only uses the parts of your system that are not in use. When you need your full system back, like during gaming or heavy work, the app automatically reduces or stops usage. It runs in isolated environments called VMs, so even if one task crashes or misbehaves, it won’t affect your machine or personal files.",
  },
  {
    value: "item-5",
    question: "What can I actually earn with Idle Finance?",
    answer:
      "Your earnings depend on the kind of hardware you have and how much of it is idle. If you have a strong GPU or high-speed internet, you may earn more. Our AI optimizer makes sure your resources are always being used in the most profitable way across networks like Grass, Flux, or Helium. You’ll see real-time earnings in your dashboard.",
  },
  {
    value: "item-6",
    question: "Do I need to know about crypto or DePINs to use Idle Finance?",
    answer:
      "No. Idle Finance is designed for non-crypto users too. The app handles blockchain interactions in the background and gives you a simple interface to monitor earnings and control your resources. You keep full control of your assets and can choose to cash out into regular tokens like USDC on the Base blockchain.",
  },
  {
    value: "item-7",
    question:
      "What is the Base blockchain, and why is Idle Finance built on it?",
    answer:
      "Base is a blockchain developed by Coinbase, known for its low fees, fast transactions, and Ethereum compatibility. We chose Base because it allows us to run smart contracts cheaply and reliably, which is essential for managing user rewards and staking. It also makes it easier to integrate with exchanges and wallets you’re already familiar with.",
  },
  {
    value: "item-8",
    question: "What is DUVI and how does it help me earn more?",
    answer:
      "DUVI stands for DePIN Utility Value Index. It’s an AI-generated score that measures how valuable your idle resource is right now based on its specs, performance, and market demand. The higher the DUVI, the more likely that resource will earn better rewards. The app uses this score to automatically match your hardware to the best-paying networks.",
  },
  {
    value: "item-9",
    question: "Will I lose control of my computer or my crypto?",
    answer:
      "No. Idle Finance is built to be non-custodial, meaning your private keys stay with you. The app can help you set up wallets, but it never stores them or moves your funds without your permission. You can stop or pause any part of the system at any time, and everything runs locally on your own machine.",
  },
  {
    value: "item-10",
    question:
      "What makes Idle Finance different from other DePIN or staking platforms?",
    answer:
      "Most DePIN platforms require technical knowledge or manual setup. Idle Finance simplifies the entire process by combining AI, virtualization, and blockchain in one desktop app. It’s designed to be plug-and-play, secure, and optimized for everyday users who want to earn passively from the resources they already own.",
